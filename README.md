Here's an infographic displaying gender statistics among Lehigh faculty. The data shows that there are more men than women on the staff and the largest difference seen is in full-time professors.

After winning the 2008 World Series, The Philadelphia Phillies continued with a few years of success followed by several years of mediocracy. The team was in a 9-year playoff drought entering the 2019 season and knew it was time to make a roster move. With the offseason underway, and free agency right around the corner, teams around the league all wanted a chance to sign Bryce Harper. He is a former Rookie of the Year, 2015 MVP, 6x all-star, and Homerun Derby champion all by the age of 26. 


The Phillies were one of the teams showing interest, and luckily for them, the interest was mutual. Since signing Harper, the Phillies have shown a noticeable improvement in offensive consistency. The team managed to have a .250 or better batting average in four of his six seasons with the team. They also hit over 200 home runs three times. Comparatively, the team pre-Harper struggled to generate such offense and the team placed bottom of the division for almost a decade.
